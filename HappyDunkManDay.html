          <p>In many ways it's only about love. It's a story of a great friendship. It's a story of overcoming mighty obstacles. It's a story of patience. It's sad. It's funny. It bizarre. It's not that long. It's full of ups and downs. But! By no means is it boring. And it ends well...

            But smart he was not, as he sat there not noticing a girl who was destined to changed his life. <br>
            He said "hi" to her by accident and never paid attantion since.<br> As I said, not smart...

             <p class="too-long">Beautiful, funny, overall the best human she was. Not hard to impress though as the fresh prince cought her eye right away.<br>
            She was intrigued, but sadly shy. She felt hopeful after prince talked to her. But her heart broke a little when that never happened again. <br>
            In fact, it seemed as though the prince was avoiding her...
            <br>
            Yet princess was brave. With the help of modern technology she reached out. But was ignored. For a whole WEEK. The princess was also stubborn, so she tried again.<br>
            Alas, the prince answered. Ruined her mario kart game, but all the same.<br>
            She rejoiced and the rest is history...

          <h3>Their(our) life together</h3>
          <p>Texting all night. Not talking to each other at parties. Couple of drunk kisses. Doctor’s appointments. Restaurants. More drunk kisses. The friends with benefits arrangement. More kisses. A couple of GATES. More kisses. Long distance. More kisses. Blablabla <br>
            <br>
          You know all that. Our history is long, even though we’re just turning 6 months… It will probably take all night to write everything down. <br>
          <br>
          I also on multiple occasions told you how much I love you and why. I don’t think I can write anything new here. <br>
          <br>
          This whole thing is just something fun, memorable, you know? <br>
          <br>
          Even though I didn’t promise you, but you once said I did, here’s a little digital album. (WE NEED TO TAKE MORE PICS TOGETHER) <br>
          <br>
          I called this section our adventures. We didn’t have many in a conventional sense of the word. <br>
          <br>
          But for me every day with you is an adventure. I always wanted to fall in love with my best friend and have adventures together. Travel. See and experience things. Share. That’s how I feel with you. <br>
          <br>
          Thanks to you, I got to try so many things I would never try on my own. New cuisines. New recipes. New places. New events. You even got me to like basketball! <br>
          <br>
          But the best new thing you gave me is the feeling of love. I’ve never felt so loved before. And I never loved someone like this. I never felt so connected to someone. I never cared and been cared for so much. <br>
          <br>
          I appreciate you. Even on the most mundane day being with you trumps being anywhere else. <br>
          <br>
          Yours truely,<br>
          Sweetlana.
